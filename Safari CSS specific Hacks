Safari 9.0 released, here are a few I created for that…

For about a month I have been working on Safari 9 (beta) – Safari 9 on iOS (and the beta which is due to be released soon for desktops) and here is the resulting set of CSS hacks for you.

/* Safari 9+ */

@supports (overflow:-webkit-marquee)
   and (justify-content:inherit) {
     .selector { property:value; } 
}

Author: Jeff Clayton
A One-Liner:

/* Safari 9+ */

_::-webkit-:not(:root:root), .selector { property:value; } 

Author: Jeff Clayton
And a One-Liner that is not for iOS:

/* Safari 9+ (non-iOS) */

_:-webkit-full-screen:not(:root:root), .selector { property:value; } 

Author: Jeff Clayton
One that targets Safari 9 but ONLY on iOS:

/* Safari 9+ (iOS Only) */

@supports (-webkit-text-size-adjust:none)
   and (not (-ms-accelerator:true)) {
     .selector { property:value; } 
}

And more…

/* Safari 10.1+ */

@media not all and (min-resolution:.001dpcm)
{ @media {
    .selector { property:value; } 
}}

Author: Jeff Clayton
/* Safari 6.1-10.0 */

@media screen and (min-color-index:0)
   and(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) { @media {
    .selector { property:value; }
}}

Author: Jeff Clayton
/* Safari 6.2,7.1+ */

_::-webkit-full-page-media, _:future, :root .selector { property:value; }

Author: Jeff Clayton
This Safari 6.1-7 one took time for me to create, and like the Chrome 29+ one, it was well worth time time and effort to invent:

/* Safari 6.1-7.0 */

@media screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0)
  and (min-color-index:0) {
    .selector {(; property:value; );}
}
