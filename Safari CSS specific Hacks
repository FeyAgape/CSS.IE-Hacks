Safari 9.0 released, here are a few I created for that…

For about a month I have been working on Safari 9 (beta) – Safari 9 on iOS (and the beta which is due to be released soon for desktops) and here is the resulting set of CSS hacks for you.

/* Safari 9+ */

@supports (overflow:-webkit-marquee)
   and (justify-content:inherit) {
     .selector { property:value; } 
}

A One-Liner:

/* Safari 9+ */

_::-webkit-:not(:root:root), .selector { property:value; } 

Author: Jeff Clayton
And a One-Liner that is not for iOS:

/* Safari 9+ (non-iOS) */

_:-webkit-full-screen:not(:root:root), .selector { property:value; } 

Author: Jeff Clayton
One that targets Safari 9 but ONLY on iOS:

/* Safari 9+ (iOS Only) */

@supports (-webkit-text-size-adjust:none)
   and (not (-ms-accelerator:true)) {
     .selector { property:value; } 
}

Author: Jeff Clayton
And more…

/* Safari 10.1+ */

@media not all and (min-resolution:.001dpcm)
{ @media {
    .selector { property:value; } 
}}

Author: Jeff Clayton
/* Safari 6.1-10.0 */

@media screen and (min-color-index:0)
   and(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) { @media {
    .selector { property:value; }
}}

Author: Jeff Clayton
/* Safari 6.2,7.1+ */

_::-webkit-full-page-media, _:future, :root .selector { property:value; }

Author: Jeff Clayton
This Safari 6.1-7 one took time for me to create, and like the Chrome 29+ one, it was well worth time time and effort to invent:

/* Safari 6.1-7.0 */

@media screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0)
  and (min-color-index:0) {
    .selector {(; property:value; );}
}

Please note: if you are using Chrome on iOS (at least in versions 6.1-9) and you wonder why none of the hacks seem to be separating Chrome from Safari, it is because the iOS version of Chrome is using the Safari engine. It uses Safari hacks not the Chrome ones. More about that here: http://allthingsd.com/20120628/googles-chrome-for-ios-is-more-like-a-chrome-plated-apple/

That out of the way here are hacks for you to use for more recent versions of Safari.

Please be aware that these are hacks, and some of them are truly non-standard CSS code (which is why only some browsers are affected by them) and will not filter through SASS or other compilers or filters because they try to remove the non-standard data or convert to cross-browser form which completely destroys what we are trying to do here. To use them anyway, in many cases you must use your filter first, then apply the hack afterward. Such is the nature of a hack and does require the extra work of either including an external unfiltered CSS file or code block afterward. 

For 9 specifically, I have been working on a page for that, so – rather than retype the same code, go here for hacks to affect Safari 9 (including a hack for iOS only now): My Safari 9 CSS Hacks

Here is one for Safari 7.1 and newer:

/* Safari 7.1+ */

_::-webkit-full-page-media, _:future, :root .safari_only {

  color:#0000FF; 
  background-color:#CCCCCC; 

}

Here is one I worked out for Safari 10.1+:
(YES the double media query is a necessity!)

/* Safari 10.1+ */

@media not all and (min-resolution:.001dpcm) { @media
{
    .safari_only { 

        color:#0000FF; 
        background-color:#CCCCCC; 

    }
}}

Author: Jeff Clayton
This hack I worked out by combining multiple other hacks is for 6.1-10.0 (not 10.1):

/* Safari 6.1-10.0 (10.1 is the latest version of Safari at this time) */

@media screen and (min-color-index:0) 
and(-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) { @media
{
    .safari_only { 

        color:#0000FF; 
        background-color:#CCCCCC; 

    }
}}

Below is a hack that separates 6.1-7.0 from the above 7.1+
These also required a combination of multiple hacks in order to get the right result:

/* Safari 6.1-7.0 */

@media screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio:0) 
and (min-color-index:0)
{  
   .safari_only {(;

      color:#0000FF; 
      background-color:#CCCCCC; 

    );}
}
